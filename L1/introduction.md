# Welcome to the Web Development Learning Lab

This learning lab is designed to help you build a strong foundation in **web development** — covering both **websites** and full-featured **web applications**.

Whether you're creating a portfolio, a form, or building toward your first web app, this lab will guide you step by step — from beginner to full stack developer.

## 🧱 What Is Web Development?

Web development involves creating everything you see and interact with in a browser. It includes:

- **Front-end development**: the visual layer using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- **Back-end development**: the server-side logic using languages like **PHP**, **JavaScript** (with **Node.js)**, **Python**, and more
- **Databases**: systems that store and manage data used by your website or app

In the Learning Lab resources, we will focus on:
- **HTML/CSS/JS** for front-end
- **PHP** and **JavaScript** (with **Node.js**) for back-end logic
- **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** for database integration
- **Responsive Design** to ensure your sites work on all devices
- **Web Accessibility** to ensure your sites are usable by everyone
- **Web Performance** to optimize loading times and user experience
- **Frameworks** for building complex applications 
- **Web Security** to protect your applications from threats
- **Git** for version control and collaboration
- **DevTools** for debugging and performance analysis
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for advanced tasks
- **APIs** for integrating external services and data
- **Deployment** to host your applications online
- **Testing** to ensure your code works as expected
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** for enhanced user experiences
- ...and much more!

## 🎨 What Is Front-End Development?

Front-end development is everything the user sees and interacts with in their browser.

It involves:
- Structuring content using **HTML**
- Styling it with **CSS**
- Making it interactive with **JavaScript**

Front-end developers focus on:
- Layout
- Typography
- Navigation
- Accessibility
- Responsive design

Everything from a page's colours to button animations happens on the front end.

## ⚙️ What Is Back-End Development?

Back-end development handles everything behind the scenes — where data is stored, processed, and delivered.

It involves:
- Server-side scripting (e.g. **PHP**, **JavaScript/Node.js**, **Python**)
- Working with **databases** like MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Processing form submissions
- Authenticating users
- Serving dynamic content

These lab resources will focus on **PHP** and **JavaScript** (with **Node.js**) for back-end training. You’ll learn how to build logic that powers real applications.

## 🗃️ What Are Databases?

A **database** is where your application stores and retrieves information — like users, messages, products, etc.

You’ll learn:
- How to create and structure tables
- How to connect to a database from your website
- How to run queries (add, update, delete, search data)
- How to use databases securely and efficiently

This lab will focus primarily on two industry-standard systems:
- **MySQL**: widely used, fast, easy to start with
- **PostgreSQL**: powerful, open-source, used for complex applications

Both are relational databases (SQL-based), and you'll learn how to:
- Create tables using SQL syntax
- Use Primary Keys (PK), Foreign Keys (FK) and other constraints
- Interact with the database through back-end code
