# ✅ Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Development

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what web development is, distinguish between websites and web applications, and recognise the core roles of front-end, back-end, and database layers.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It includes both what the user sees (**front-end**) and what happens behind the scenes (**back-end** and **databases**).

### Website vs. Web Application

* A **website** is mostly static, like a blog or portfolio.
* A **web application** is interactive and dynamic — like a booking system, dashboard, or social platform.

### Three Core Layers

| Layer         | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-end** | Everything the user sees and interacts with (HTML, CSS, JS)          |
| **Back-end**  | Logic, data processing, and dynamic functionality                    |
| **Database**  | Persistent storage of information like users, messages, and products |

### Common Technologies

* **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Back-end**: PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), Python
* **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL

## 🧩 Real-World Example

> Think of an online store:
>
> * **Front-end**: what the user sees — product listings, buttons, cart
> * **Back-end**: handles user logins, product filtering, and checkout logic
> * **Database**: stores user accounts, product details, and order history

## 🛠️ Lab Task

Create a simple `README.md` file in your own words that answers:

1. What is the difference between a website and a web application?
2. What are the 3 parts of a full stack and what does each one do?
3. What are two technologies you might use for each layer?

💡 Use bullet points, code formatting (`like this`), and headings (`## Title`) where relevant.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Always separate your content (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS).
* Understand the roles before writing code — planning structure saves time.
* Learn the terminology: you’ll hear “full stack”, “client-side”, and “server-side” often.

---

## 🔁 Suggested Extensions

* Interview a classmate or teacher: “What’s the most confusing part of web development when starting?”
* Try drawing a diagram of how front-end, back-end, and database interact.

## ⏱️ Pressure Test – Foundational Web Development

### 🧪 Task Overview

Create a short summary that clearly explains the three layers of web development (front-end, back-end, and database), and list one example of a language or technology used in each.

### 🔧 Requirements

* Use proper Markdown formatting (`##`, `-`, `**bold**`, etc.)
* Include a basic diagram (text-based is fine) showing the relationship between the three layers
* Submit it as a `.md` file named `pressure-test-l1.md`

### ⏳ Time Limit

15–20 minutes
