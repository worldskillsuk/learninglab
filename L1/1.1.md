# ✅ Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Development

---

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what web development is, distinguish between websites and web applications, and recognise the core roles of front-end, back-end, and database layers.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It includes both what the user sees (**front-end**) and what happens behind the scenes (**back-end** and **databases**).

### Website vs. Web Application

* A **website** is mostly static, like a blog or portfolio.
* A **web application** is interactive and dynamic — like a booking system, dashboard, or social platform.

### Three Core Layers

| Layer         | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-end** | Everything the user sees and interacts with (HTML, CSS, JS)          |
| **Back-end**  | Logic, data processing, and dynamic functionality                    |
| **Database**  | Persistent storage of information like users, messages, and products |

### Common Technologies

* **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Back-end**: PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), Python
* **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL

## 🧩 Real-World Example

> Think of an online store:
>
> * **Front-end**: what the user sees — product listings, buttons, cart
> * **Back-end**: handles user logins, product filtering, and checkout logic
> * **Database**: stores user accounts, product details, and order history

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Always separate your content (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS).
* Understand the roles before writing code — planning structure saves time.
* Learn the terminology: you’ll hear “full stack”, “client-side”, and “server-side” often.

## 📝 Evaluation Task – Lesson 1 Check-in

⏱️ **Allocated Time:** 10 minutes

### ❓ Answer the following questions:

1. What is the main difference between a website and a web application?
2. Name the three core layers of web development.
3. What does the front-end of a web application control?
4. Name one technology commonly used for each of the following: front-end, back-end, and database.
5. Which layer is responsible for processing user logins and handling data?

### ✅ Evaluation Task

**Performance Boundaries:**

* **13–15**: Excellent understanding
* **9–12**: Good grasp with minor gaps
* **5–8**: Basic awareness, needs reinforcement
* **0–4**: Major misunderstandings, revisit the material

| Q1         | Clear, complete distinction           | Mostly correct distinction  | Partial or vague explanation | Incorrect or missing |
| Q2         | All 3 layers identified and explained | 2 layers correct            | 1 layer mentioned            | None identified      |
| Q3         | Fully correct description             | Mostly correct              | Limited understanding        | Incorrect or missing |
| Q4         | All 3 correct & relevant              | 2 tech match correct layers | 1 correct tech or vague      | Incorrect or missing |
| Q5         | Back-end clearly explained            | Mostly accurate             | Vague or partial             | Incorrect or missing |

## 🔁 Suggested Extensions

* Interview a classmate or teacher: “What’s the most confusing part of web development when starting?”
* Try drawing a diagram of how front-end, back-end, and database interact.
